# 專案啟動與設置

## 啟動
你的作品在拿起紙筆之前就開始了。與客戶首次見面的準備，設計流程就已經啟動。在首次接觸顯得充分準備且專業，就能開始建立關係。你的專業會獲得的回報會很多：就是客戶對你的決策有滿出來的信任。

**在此部分可以學到：**
- 在首次會面之前與過程中要問什麼問題
- 溝通小訣竅：如何跟客戶說話
- 如何設定 Google 雲端硬碟和 inVision 備料資料夾
- 客戶最常問的問題

**利害關係人**
- 客戶
- 設計師
- 業務開發代表
- 專案經理
- 開發者

## Kick-off 會議檢查清單
### 在首次與客戶見面之前：
與專案經理開會，蒐集所有專案的訊息。讓專案經理 (PM)、業務開發 (BD) 和開發團隊知道：不要把相同的問題問客戶兩遍。你要知道的事情：
- 客戶已有正在使用的產品嗎？
    - 如果有，可以考慮先做 [UX 檢查](https://www.netguru.co/services/ux-review){:target="_blank"}。
- 產品有清楚的範疇 (scope) 嗎？
    - 是/否（在此階段，產品應該已經有範疇。沒有的話，就要進行一次範疇流程。）
- 專案的構想是否已經足以進行設計？
    - 我們在 Netguru 會進行 [產品設計衝刺 (Product Design Sprints)](https://www.netguru.co/services/product-design-sprint){:target="_blank"}，幫助客戶充實想法。
- 設計給哪個平台？
- 如果是網頁設計，要做響應式 (responsive) 嗎？
- 工程開發階段是由我們的團隊進行嗎？

### 首次會面 - 向客戶解釋流程：
- **讓客戶知道**
    - 產品設計是一組流程，即是可以讓產品或服務變得更好的反覆修改 (iterations)。客戶和使用者的目標皆達成時，即是完成最後一次修改。
    - 設計不僅僅只看外觀，還有其運作原理。
讓客戶知道你的角色與期望。在一開始就要設立界線與期望。

- **Avoid multi-platform designs at the early stages of the project**
If the client needs a multi-platform design, ask another designer for help. If you believe that the scope is big enough, always suggest a design team. Learn more from: [Why a Team Approach Is the Key to Successful Product Design](https://www.netguru.co/blog/why-a-team-approach-is-the-key-to-successful-product-design){:target="_blank"}
- **Emphasize that it’s impossible to predict users’ behavior accurately**
We rely on research and available data – the validity of a solution can only be assessed with relevant tests.
- **We cannot guarantee a business success**
Try to make it clear that even the best product design does not guarantee a product’s success in terms of revenue.
- **Give a quick overview of all the Product Design phases**

### First meeting – get some info from the client:
**General info**
- What is your deadline? (design/release date)
- What will make the application a success in your opinion?
- What will make our work a success in your eyes?
- Have you collected any user feedback yet?
- Can you grant us access to your analytics tools?
- Are there any similar products or alternative solutions to the same problem? What are your potential customers doing today instead of using your future product?

#### Questions specific to UX Review:
- On the call, try to establish the scope of the review:
    - The narrower, the better – a more focused scope is superior.
    - Try to get to know the client’s requirements and expectations for the review.
    - Try to get to know what user journeys are key to the client.
    - In a perfect scenario, narrow down the scope to just one.
- After the call, discuss the client’s requirements within the team and ask the team about possible blockers.

#### Visual:
- Do you have a branding, brand book, brand guidelines?
    - If not, give a heads-up about the importance of those in the later phases.
- If the client wants to use corporate fonts in the UI, be sure they own a web/mobile licence.
- If you suggest an alternative paid font for the UI, be sure that the client is open to buying a licence.
- Does the client have any benchmarks or a visual style in mind?
- Does the client have the source files for the old designs?

Make sure that all answers are documented and available for other team members – both current and future.

## Communication tips
#### General rules:
- Be active, not passive – recommend solutions.
- Listen to the client’s expectations, don’t be afraid to ask questions.
- Consult your solutions with the developers from day one.
- Make sure you explain to the client how to use communication tools e.g. comments in [InVision](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/209192426-How-do-I-comment-on-a-prototype-){:target="_blank"}; explain the difference between [tour-points](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/204183549){:target="_blank"} and comments

#### Feedback
- Does the client have enough time to give you feedback? If not, try to ask which active stakeholders can actively participate in the communication.
- Make the client aware of the value of an active and collaborative approach (feedback, communication).
- Make sure that there is only one final point of feedback on the client’s part.
- Make sure that you will have an opportunity to present your solutions to all stakeholders.
- Make sure that the client knows that we don’t work on the basis of a fixed number of reviews but rather in a constant feedback-and-iteration mode.

#### Previous experience:
- Has the client worked with designers before?
    - If not, try to educate the client on the best practices and basic principles of design during your meetings.
    - If yes, what are the client’s experiences of working with designers?
- Does the client understand the role of a designer?

#### Milestones & priorities
- Make sure that the client has a reasonable approach to the creation of an [MVP](https://www.netguru.co/blog/first-a-definition-the-minimum-viable-product-is){:target="_blank"} (keep the scope small).
- Make the client aware of the importance of going step-by-step in terms of functionalities.

#### Why is it important to sell the outcomes of your work?
- By selling yourself or your work well, you gain the client’s trust in your decision.
- When you hesitate or don’t know the “whys” behind your design decision, you scare clients off.

#### Must-haves when communicating with a client:
- Know the benefits and outcomes of your work.
- Gain the client’s trust – they will care about your opinions.
- Your client’s future often depends on you, your decisions, and your work. Everything you do serves to convince them that their business is in good hands.
- Don’t ask basic questions to which you can easily find answers on Google.
- Every decision you make must match the business goals of your client – always and unconditionally.
- You can use the structure:
[What you did] + [how you came up with the thing you did] + [why you did it/how this will help the client’s business]
- **There are no maybes – there is confidence.** Be absolutely sure about your statements.
- Speak about the “whys” of your design and how your work will improve your client’s chances of achieving success.
- Don’t talk about the things the client can see on their own. Say it this way: “This element is placed here because it will help X achieve Y/with Z”.
- Use data. Whenever you assume something, base it on best practices, behavior studies, and statistics.
- It’s much better to present a small number of excellent arguments than flood the client with dozens of mediocre ones.
- Adjust your language – don’t use jargon.

## Gathering feedback
We use InVision at Netguru as the main tool for gathering feedback on each iteration and for keeping all comments in one place. [Check out how it works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J09zw08ihw4){:target="_blank"} We also have a dedicated process to get more precise feedback from other designers within our team.

#### From Teammates
Remember that if you have any difficulties with your design, you can always ask other designers for feedback. It’s also important to share your solutions with the team before sharing them with the client. With this approach, you can improve your designs, spot bugs or logic issues in your solutions or, alternatively, read people’s praise for you and collect thumbs-ups.

- Just go to your team (use messaging apps or simply talk to them), share a link to your designs and ask for some help, opinions or comments.
- Ask another designer for a review.
- If you are not sure whether you can spend more time preparing dedicated designs, ask your PM if you have enough resources/time/money to develop such features.

#### From the client
Gathering feedback from the client is the key to a successful project.
- Ask for the feedback you want to receive.
- Add designs to the project and share a link with the client. The best way to go is to always keep links to your designs in a project management tool, e.g. Jira.
- Ask whether the client knows how your tools work or just guide the client through the process of adding comments to designs (mentioning a user’s name when adding a comment will send an e-mail notification – recommended).
- Reply to comments and mark them as resolved.
- If something is unclear to you or the client, try to explain until everything is crystal clear to both parties.
- Preparing clickable designs (links between views) will enhance the client’s experience.
- Stay in touch with the client. Send the client up-to-date links to the designs and give progress updates. Last but not least, ask the client about the feelings and emotions that the design evokes.
- You get in touch with the client to present your designs. Sometimes, you need to sell your vision or just present the bigger picture behind your designs.

## 設計文件 - 組織架構
在這個階段將介紹默認情況下我們所建立的組織文件與資料夾。當然，我們的文件架構僅是一個範例，你可以運用最適合你的方式去建立你的組織文件及資料夾。


#### 1. 準備

當我們進行一個新專案，我們會在客戶的主要文件中建立一個給設計師的資料夾

{% include image.html img="image7.png" img2x="Image7@2x.png" alt="Designer folder" %}

#### 2. 該設計師資料夾的架構

{% include image.html img="image2.png" img2x="Image2@2x.png" alt="Designer folder structure" %}

**A. 原檔**

{% include image.html img="image3.png" img2x="Image3@2x.png" alt="Sources folders" %}

E每個資料夾（視覺和wireframes）將包含所有原檔（.psd, .sketch 等等）。 視每個專案而定，但假如我們有兩種檔案， 我們就會為 .psd, .sketch, 或任何其他擴充文件建立子文件夾。
{% include image.html img="image1.png" img2x="Image1@2x.png" alt="Source files subfolders" %}

所有原檔的預覽將以 .jpg或 .png 格式呈現


**B. 字型**

這個資料夾中， 我們將專案中用過的所有字型放在這裡， 即使是免費字型也一樣。他們會以字型名稱被群組起來，範例如下：

{% include image.html img="image5.png" img2x="Image5@2x.png" alt="Fonts folder" %}

**C. 資源(Assets)與輸出(export)**

這個資料夾包含兩個子資料夾：

{% include image.html img="image9.png" img2x="Image9@2x.png" alt="Assets and Exports subfolders" %}

assets & Exports 是提供給前端工程師使用的。

- 資源 (assets)

資源包含所有我們無法放在輸出資料夾 (Exports) 所額外補充的的資源，舉例來說 :SVG、icon 等等

- 輸出 (Exports)

在輸出資料夾中，我們將所有Sketch 和 Photoshop的匯出檔放在這裡。

**D. 圖檔和 Icon (images&icons)**

如果我們有一些額外的圖檔（Shutterstock等等圖資源）或是 icon set，我們會上傳到這裡。

**E. Documentation**

非常重要！在專案的最後，我們可以為所有畫面建立連結網址，利用InVision app將每個連結將連到指定的畫面，打破不同平台、斷點的藩籬去溝通(不確定有沒有翻對we create a list of all screens with URLs to particular screens on the InVisionApp broken down by different platforms, breakpoints, and so on.)


在這個資料夾中，我們會上傳跟所有跟實際專案有關的文件。這些文件可以是人物誌(persona) 和 使用者旅程 (user stories) 等等。

我們也會建立一個初次測試 (Initial interview) 的子資料夾，內含跟初次測試期間的重要數據收集，客戶提供的跟專案還有設計階段相關的資源或是scoping session

{% include image.html img="image8.png" img2x="Image8@2x.png" alt="Initial interview folder" %}

## 你的客戶可能會問
{% include qa.html question="為什麼你要了解商業模式 (business model)？" answer="這可以幫助我們專注在更重要的工作與優先執行的項目" %}

{% include qa.html question="為什麼你在我們會議前就要先知道這些事情？" answer="這些可以讓我們在會議前準備得更充足並專心在我們的會議上面" %}

{% include qa.html question="We don’t have: 我們沒有什麼「商業分析、市場調查、主要受眾的基礎」。你可以幫我們做嗎？" answer="我們可以支援一部分的工作。" %}

### 這個階段你應該問自己的問題：
- 我有學問過所有必要的問題了嗎？
- 我已經得到所有必要的答案了嗎？
- 在跟客戶的第一次會議中已搜集專案所需的必要資源了嗎？
- 這個專案流程已經跟客戶對過了嗎？
- 專案架構已經被建立了嗎？
- 合乎所有螢幕裝置的InVision原型(prototypes)已經建立好了嗎？
