# 設計

## 介紹
**在這個章節，你將會學到：**
- 到哪裡可以找到靈感
- 如何收集靈感與準備情緒板 ( moodboard )
- 如何準備風格樣式指南
- 如何準備一個特定的設計階段
- 在不同特定裝置上設計的小技巧
- 最好的團隊協作練習
- 在哪裡可以找到設計資源
- 設計草稿的小技巧

我們設計東西是在透過一套可用的資源，給出可以解決問題的用途一個形式。好的設計是解決一個問題，所以他首先看起來是沒有什麼問題的。好的介面設計、溝通過程，或是物件的操作是不需要耗費使用者太多的力氣的。好的設計會讓你想到：天啊，我本來應該可以靠自己做到的！<br>
是的，良好的設計物件通常是一個令人愉悅的看待或是體驗。在一些案例裡面，這些形式將會處於功能之前。

## 靈感
**替專案找到一個準確的風格**<br>
當你開始設計一個新專案，要記得靈感激發的過程是具有評論性的。 關於一個應用程式/網站整體的感受，取決於你使用的顏色、字型或照片。
**記住：不要抄襲，只管汲取更多靈感！**

你可以在這裡找尋靈感：
- [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com){:target="_blank"}
- [Dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com){:target="_blank"}
- [Behance](http://www.behance.com){:target="_blank"}
- [Designspiration](http://www.designspiration.net){:target="_blank"}
- [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com){:target="_blank"}

### 準備情緒板
這個步驟是對你和你的客戶來說是必要的。在未來，當然，在一個當你完成你的設計的情況下，並且客戶是感到非常愉快的 - 但這將不會永遠是這麼回事。我們建議你準備一個板子包含許多的照片和圖片，向你的客戶展示什麼是你想設計在這個未來的應用程式上的，什麼樣的「感覺」是你的設計將會喚起的，還有最後，什麼是你的客戶可以期待的。托這個方式的福，你將會增加客戶喜歡你的解決方案的機會，還有你也會表現出你欣賞你的客戶的回饋的樣子。**大概所需時間: 4小時** 造訪 [這個連結](https://netguru.invisionapp.com/boards/3M37AJO452DFW/){:target="_blank"} 去查看一個情緒板的範本。

**如何準備一個情緒板？**<br>
我們使用 InVision 的白板的理由如下：
- 較有彈性
- 有立即可用的樣板
- 提供加入圖片、字型和附件的功能選項

當然，你也可以隨意選擇你使用的工具！

## 風格指南
在研究階段之後立即開始創造一個風格指南是好的。在最初的版本，風格指南至少應該要包含顏色跟字體。在整個視覺設計階段，你應該要更新你的風格指南到一個完整的版本。

**一個好的風格指南應該包含什麼？**
- **顏色** (主要使用的顏色和每一個顏色逐漸變化的程度)<br>
實用的工具： [Coolors](https://coolors.co/app){:target="_blank"}, [Color Adobe](https://color.adobe.com/explore/?filter=most-popular&time=all){:target="_blank"}
- **文字排版** (字型和字體大小)<br>
為了讓你的設計保持簡單，限制你所用到字體的數量和尺寸。 依照一般的經驗法則，從最多兩個字型開始 - 一個給你的標頭使用，另外一個給你的內文使用。大部分的時間，你不會需要用到更多。<br>
我們高度推薦使用免費字型。如果你想要使用一個付費字型，小心確認這各字型的使用權限。你的客戶可能會不情願的為了字型去付多餘的費用，所以確認他們真的想要花錢在字型上。<br>
免費字型： [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/){:target="_blank"}<br>
付費字型： [MyFonts](http://www.myfonts.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Typekit](https://typekit.com/){:target="_blank"}<br>
有關於字型付費的麻煩嗎？ 試試 [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/){:target="_blank"} 或 [FontPairs](https://fontpair.co/){:target="_blank"}<br>
- **元件庫** (設計階段)<br>
以元件為基礎的思考幫助工程師。設計元件可以恰好的的轉譯進程式碼。從工程師的視角來看，元件看起來就像是你可以放在一起的樂高積木。<br>
舉例：
  - 按鈕 (一般狀態、滑鼠移到連結的狀態、啟動的狀態、不能使用的狀態)
  - 表單輸入欄位 (空白狀態、選取狀態、輸入中狀態、錯誤狀態、成功狀態)
- **網格和間隔**<br>
為每一個使用案例去建立網格系統是重要的。在網格的這個部分，包含了在數個欄位和列位、間距和範例使用上的資訊。

## States of design
During the design process, you have to keep in mind that your UI can be in different states:

**1. Nothing**

Maybe it’s the first time a user sees a view, interface element, or status. Maybe it hasn't been activated yet. Essentially, the component exists but hasn’t started working yet.

**2. Loading**

The dreaded state. In a perfect world, no one would ever see this. Alas, here we find ourselves. There are plenty of ways to keep your loading state subtle and unobtrusive.

**3. None**

Your component has initialized, but it’s empty. No data. No Items. Now may be a good time to get the user to act (“Do this!”), or to reward them (“Good job, everything has been taken care of”).

**4. One**

You have some data. On input, this might come after the first keystroke. In a list, it might be when you have one item (or only one item left).

**5. Some**

This is usually what you think of first. What is the ideal state for this component? Your data is loaded, you have input, and the user is familiar with it.

**6. Too many**

The user has overdone it in some way. Too many results (maybe you paginate them now), too many characters (maybe ellipses?), and so on.

**7. Incorrect**

Something is not right about the component. An error has occurred.

**8. Correct**

This item has had its requirements satisfied.

**9. Done**

The user’s correct input has been received by the application. The user doesn’t have to worry about it anymore.

These states will recur based on the page, user interaction, updated data, and pretty much any change to your application’s state. By thoughtfully designing these changes, you can create a polished experience for users no matter which situation they find themselves in.

## Designing specifics for native mobile apps
If you are only starting to design native apps, the best thing to do is to read the official guidelines for the Android (Material Design) and iOS (Human Interface Guidelines) operating systems.

**Apple’s iPhones**

### Designing for gestures in general
Use [the most popular gestures](https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/in-app-gestures-and-mobile-app-user-experience/){:target="_blank"} to make application even more interactive. Remember that when using your phone, there is no “right click” as would be the case with browsing websites on a computer. Try to put the most popular and intuitive gestures in areas where users might expect them.

**Mobile app interactions matter**<br>

## Designing in Teams: Best Practices

{% include dosndonts.html introduction="1. Start every project with a brainstorming session." dos="
Debate and encourage wild ideas.
| Capture the ideas in a tool available for the whole group
| Number your ideas and go for quantity.
| Having a non-designer present during brainstorming brings diversity to the table.
" donts="
Do not criticize. Suspend any judgment until the end of the session.
"%}

{% include dosndonts.html introduction="2. Be sure to know your responsibilities and the overall team hierarchy." dos="
Make sure you clearly understand your role and the tasks you’re responsible for.
| When responsible for task distribution, be sure to balance skill sets and eliminate gaps
" donts="
Don’t forget about the project timeline and task deadlines.
"%}

{% include dosndonts.html introduction="3. When a design conflict emerges, bring the discussion back to the business objectives." dos="
When a conflict arises, collect all arguments from the team and choose the solution that serves your product’s business objectives better.
| Support your ideas with real-life examples and surveys.
" donts="
Don’t let aesthetics or personal preferences be your primary guide when searching for solutions.
| Do not try to reinvent the wheel: always make sure that your problem hasn’t already been solved by someone else.
| Don’t forget about the project timeline and task deadlines.
"%}

{% include dosndonts.html introduction="4. Be a team player and work to deliver the business objectives." dos="
Be responsive and helpful: if a team member asks you for urgent feedback, give it a high priority.
| Solve conflicts and misunderstandings within the team quickly: personal conflicts tend to escalate.
" donts="
Don’t take credit for the final design on your own.
| Don’t get too attached to your designs – your teammates’ solutions might be better than yours.
"%}

{% include dosndonts.html introduction="5. Prepare your files properly." dos="
Use consistent naming conventions; standardize the folder naming within your design software. Tools as Sketch, Adobe XD, or Invision Studio work best when all layers have proper naming and a consistent hierarchy.
| Use shared text styles and shared colors wherever possible.
| Create symbols and instances for recurrent patterns.
| Try to split your designs using artboards or pages.
" donts="
Don’t scatter files around: use one location for all the project’s assets – ideally a shared folder.
| Be on the lookout for bad layer or file naming.
| Don’t leave your layers ungrouped and unnamed: your team member might need to pick up from your file.
"%}

{% include dosndonts.html introduction="6. Give feedback and be open to feedback." dos="
Ask your team for feedback on every step. Have regular design reviews.
| Before presenting your work to the client, be sure to get feedback from the whole design team via a messaging app or in person.
" donts="
Don’t be stubborn and accept constructive criticism – you won’t grow without feedback.
"%}

{% include dosndonts.html introduction="7. Presenting and defending your ideas." dos="
Knowing why your design works is the key to explaining and defending it well.
| Do research on the ideas you try to convince the client to.
| Know the numbers behind your solutions.
" donts="
Don’t use jargon when presenting your work – the client doesn’t have to know what persona or above-the-fold mean.
"%}

{% include dosndonts.html introduction="8. Embrace the culture of communication." dos="
Communicate clearly, early and often.
| It’s a good idea to have a live call with the client when presenting the designs for the first time – this way you will have an opportunity to answer all questions and avoid misunderstandings.
" donts="
Don’t be afraid to ask – remember that there are no stupid questions.
| Don’t assume your client knows how to use collaboration tools.
| Don’t leave designs of complicated processes without any comments.
"%}

## Nice-to-haves when designing

### Prepare interactive designs
If there is enough time, try to search for ready transitions between the elements of your designed interface. This will greatly enhance the experience of users, as animations in your project can do magic. To prepare such interactions, you can use:
1. **Principle.** Use _Principle_ when you need to animate interface elements, especially in a multi-screen project; the built-in transitions and element-based animations will help create quick and easily clickable prototypes. _Principle_ should be your go-to tool if:
  - you need to build a quick prototype to check if a UI solution works;
  - you want to make sure the developer knows how to code the interaction;
  - you want to enrich the experience by creating meaningful animations;
  - you want to showcase your design on social media.
2. **Adobe After Effects.** _AE_ is a true workhorse – it can do almost everything related to animation. While versatile and powerful, _After Effects_ could be better when it comes to working with Sketch files. _AE_ also won’t allow you to test your interactions on a prototype. _After Effects_ is your go-to tool if:
  - you need custom transitions or animation effects;
  - you need to use perspective or other video effects;
  - you want to animate icons and illustrations.

### Craft your own icons
If there is enough time, you can create your own icon set. We use _Nucleo_ for our designs, but creating your own icons will add a more individual feeling to the application.

## Questions your client may ask

{% include qa.html question="Why is designing in teams better?" answer="You get a broader skillset and the team’s collective experience (complementary teams have members with unique skills such as UX, visual design, or illustration). Problems are solved more efficiently because team members instantly verify each other’s incorrect assumptions and bad solutions. The work efficiency also increases, because tasks are distributed in a smart way (certain designers work faster on certain tasks). The chances of the product’s success increase, because teams offer more idea-creation power and instant second opinion with full-context feedback." %}

{% include qa.html question="What’s the difference between a design and a wireframe?" answer="A wireframe is a basic visual guide that serves as a blueprint that defines each project’s structure, content, and functionality. By using very simple elements without paying attention to visuals, we can focus on finding the best user experience solutions and creating iterations faster and more cost-efficiently." %}

{% include qa.html question="Why do I have to pay for fonts?" answer="Paid fonts are usually of higher quality and contain a broader range of styles and weights (which will give the designers more freedom in hierarchy design), additional glyphs and ligatures, and a decent kerning table. A paid font also helps to build a unique visual voice by making the product easier to stand out from the crowd. This seems to be of small importance, but keep in mind that web and mobile products are based on typography in 95%. By using a quality font, you make sure your product design will also be of the highest possible quality." %}

{% include qa.html question="Why do I need to have custom icons, why can’t we just buy some?" answer="Icons and illustrations are not just about pretty pictures – they convey a message. By using custom-made images, you can be sure that they illustrate the concept accurately. Just as brands use corporate colors and fonts, a unique visual style can help to differentiate you from your competition and will speak a consistent visual language." %}

{% include qa.html question="I don’t work in Sketch, how can I see the designs?" answer="We can provide you with many different file types: flattened PNGs, multi-layer PDFs, or comprehensive documentation in an HTML file with all the necessary information for your developer. For feedback, we use InVision, which is a browser-based prototyping tool with conversation-like commenting." %}

{% include qa.html question="Where can I find some inspiration?" answer="The best sources of inspiration would be _Behance_ (behance.net) and _Dribbble_ (dribbble.com). " %}

{% include qa.html question="What is a style guide and why do I need one?" answer="A style guide is a type of template that contains colors, fonts and commonly used interface elements, which will standardize the look and feel of the whole product. It helps to keep a consistent visual style across all screens and devices and during the whole design process. It is especially useful on multi-designer projects, where every team member is responsible for a different part of the product." %}

{% include qa.html question="Why do you want to know the business model?" answer="A style guide is a type of template that contains colors, fonts, and commonly used interface elements, which will standardize the look and feel of the whole product. It helps to keep a consistent visual style across all screens and devices and during the whole design process. It is especially useful in multi-designer projects, where every team member is responsible for a different part of the product." %}

{% include qa.html question="What kind of feedback would you like me to give?" answer="Designers always try to deliver solutions that serve both the user and the business itself – you can try to check if the designs serve the business objectives and fit the industry. Remember that the aesthetics are often a matter of personal taste, and your esthetics might not converge on the universal esthetics for your product’s potential users." %}

**Questions to ask yourself at this stage**
- Do I have a moodboard?
- Do I have a style guide?
- Have I designed for all target devices and design states?
- Have I collected feedback from client and the team?

## Desired outcomes of this stage
- Moodboard (example [here](https://netguru.invisionapp.com/boards/D834FYVZBKNWP){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://netguru.invisionapp.com/boards/F736L21WBKCPU){:target="_blank"})
- Style guide (check an example of [Taqsim Style Guide](https://netguru.invisionapp.com/share/7UAMU5OB3#/screens){:target="_blank"} and short [article about color](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/P79V1I7NK#/screens/212581073){:target="_blank"})
